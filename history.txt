how to host the scite-files documentation
===============================

1) stored in .md files in the repo,
github-flavored-markdown had some limitations though,
and so this didn't really look the way i wanted.
for example, on github like this,
all images must be links for some reason.

2) 
so I moved it to gh-pages,
if you make a "ghpages" branch of your repo,
and put test.html there,
then github will host your files onto
downpoured.github.io/myrepo/test.html

3)
but that's kind of a weird hidden feature,
and I (at the time) wanted to use downpoured.github.io
as my personal website, so i moved it to a
"github wiki"
you access the wiki through the web interface,
and it looks fairly good. it even has a little menu
of pages on the right.

4)
moved it all to my moltenjs.com
personal website.
how i removed the wiki:
git clone https://github.com/moltenform/scite-with-python.wiki.git
and removed the files
and pushed

5)
you can still access this at
moltenform.github.io/scite-with-python
but it's pretty hidden
you can't even get there from 
downpoured.github.io/scite-with-python
well, I'll fix the urls anyways, just for completion
to point to moltenform.com
