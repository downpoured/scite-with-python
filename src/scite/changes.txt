Leaving notes here, these steps will be taken when a new version of SciTE is released.

Moved properties and doc to a subdirectory,
	updated cxx source to look for properties/SciTEGlobal.properties instead of SciTEGlobal.properties

Combine some uncommonly used properties files into one file (others.properties)
	move the ones to combine into one directory
	cd to that directory. ensure unix tools are in the path.
	tail -n +1 * > ../others.properties
	open ../others.properties and replace "==> " with "## ==> "
	
Generate table of SciTE commands
	edit archive/generate/constantsTable.py to point to SciTE.h
	run archive/generate/constantsTable.py
	review the output and fill in any missing entries marked by "NOTSEENBEFORE"
	paste the output into scite/scite/src/PythonExtension.cxx, into the table "static IFaceConstant rgFriendlyNamedIDMConstants[]"
