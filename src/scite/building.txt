Building in Linux
----------------------------------------
    # install prereqs
    sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
    sudo apt-get install python2.7-dev

    # build scintilla and scite
    mkdir ~/scite-with-python
    cd ~/scite-with-python
    git clone https://github.com/moltenjs/scite-with-python.git
    cd scite-with-python/src/scite/scintilla/gtk
    make
    cd ../../scite/gtk
    make
    sudo make install

    # run scite
    /usr/bin/SciTE_with_python
    
Building in Windows
----------------------------------------
Install Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7
	Freely available at https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=44266
	Download VCForPython27.msi,
	then in an admin prompt, run
	msiexec /i VCForPython27.msi ALLUSERS=1
	
Build Scintilla
	Open a command prompt 
	cd to C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0
	run vcvarsall.bat
	cd to src/scite/scintilla/win32
	run nmake -f scintilla.mak
	
Build SciTE
	Open a command prompt 
	cd to C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft\Visual C++ for Python\9.0
	run vcvarsall.bat
	cd to src/scite/scite/win32
	run nmake -f scite.mak

unzip libs
	Unzip src/scite/scite/python/libs.zip into src/scite/scite/python/libs
	Unzip src/scite/scite/bin/pythonbinaries.zip into src/scite/scite/bin
	Unzip src/scite/scite/bin/tools_internal/wincommondialog/wincommondialog.zip into tools_internal/wincommondialog/

(The specific compiler version is used so that any binary .pyd plugins for python 2.7 will be compatible with the msvc c runtime.)



Original Scintilla+SciTE build instructions with many more details
-------------------------------------------
README for building of Scintilla and SciTE
-
-Scintilla can be built by itself.
-To build SciTE, Scintilla must first be built.
-
-
-*** GTK+/Linux version ***
-
-You must first have GTK+ 2.18 or later and GCC (4.8 or better) installed.
-GTK+ 1.x will not work.
-Other C++ compilers may work but may require tweaking the make file.
-
-To build Scintilla, use the makefile located in the scintilla/gtk directory
-	cd scintilla/gtk
-	make
-	cd ../..
-
-To build and install SciTE, use the makefile located in the scite/gtk directory
-	cd scite/gtk
-	make
-	sudo make install
-
-This installs SciTE into $prefix/bin. The value of $prefix is determined from
-the location of Gnome if it is installed. This is usually /usr if installed
-with Linux or /usr/local if built from source. If Gnome is not installed
-/usr/bin is used as the prefix. The prefix can be overridden on the command
-line like "make prefix=/opt" but the same value should be used for both make
-and make install as this location is compiled into the executable. The global
-properties file is installed at $prefix/share/scite/SciTEGlobal.properties.
-The language specific properties files are also installed into this directory.
-
-To remove SciTE
-	sudo make uninstall
-
-To clean the object files which may be needed to change $prefix
-	make clean
-
-The current make file only supports static linking between SciTE and Scintilla.
-
-
-*** Windows version ***
-
-A C++ compiler is required, with C++11 required for building SciTE.
-Visual Studio 2015 is the development system used for most development
-although Mingw32 4.8 is also supported.
-
-To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/win32 directory
-		cd scintilla\win32
-GCC:		mingw32-make
-VS .NET:	nmake -f scintilla.mak
-		cd ..\..
-
-To build SciTE, use the makefiles located in the scite/win32 directory
-		cd scite\win32
-GCC:		mingw32-make
-VS .NET: 	nmake -f scite.mak
-
-An executable SciTE will now be in scite/bin.
-
-*** GTK+/Windows version ***
-
-Mingw32 is known to work. Other compilers will probably not work.
-
-Only Scintilla will build with GTK+ on Windows. SciTE will not work.
-
-To build Scintilla, make in the scintilla/gtk directory
-	cd scintilla\gtk
-	mingw32-make
-
-*** OS X Cocoa version ***
-
-Xcode 6 or 7 may be used to build Scintilla on OS X.
-
-There is no open source version of SciTE for OS X but there is a commercial
-version available through the App Store.
-
-To build Scintilla, run xcodebuild in the scintilla/cocoa/ScintillaFramework directory
-        cd cocoa/ScintillaFramework
-	xcodebuild
-
-*** Qt version ***
-
-See the qt/README file to build Scintilla with Qt.
