# SciTE-with-Python

A fork of the SciTE code editor that adds Python extensiblity. In addition to standard multi-tab code editing, this project lets you create plugins to help you write code more efficiently.
    
* plugins can use the Python standard library, for example,

    * sorting the selected lines of text
    
    * restyling ranges of text to underline or highlight
    
    * automating nearly every editor action
    
    * showing an interactive GUI inside the code editor
    
    * shelling out to other tools with Python's subprocess
    
* plugins can register for events like OnKey, OnOpen, and OnSave, for example,

    * letting you listen for multi-key keyboard shortcuts
    
    * auto-completing xml tags, or writing snippets a la TextMate
    
    * showing file metadata when files are opened

* additions to SciTE include

    * use "menukey" to customize keyboard bindings
    
    * find-text-in-files now has regular expression support

    * when multiple editor windows are open, the search state is shared
    
    * 26 plugins for manipulating text, finding filenames, and navigating to declaration/definition of the selection in C source code
